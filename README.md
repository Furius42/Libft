First Cursus Assignment in 42 Prague

This assignement was complicated for me since I have started it and had to halt work on it half way through (the easier half) before having a newborn baby come to my life.
Coming back to learn to code after having my head deep in diapers for nearly 10 months I have forgotten a lot.
It felt like starting over again. But this time it wasnt the piscine.. the vibe changed, I was alone now. 
..

I have had to ask for 36 extra days to be able to get back into it and complete this assignment.
The code as of now is not written in concise form. Some functions have been written at the very beginning of my cursus, some after the break.
I feel I will eventually have to come back to it and rewrite my functions. Unite the form in which it is written across the board. Finish all the main() functions..

The functions as of now do work. The assignment is completed without Bonuses. Just the bare minimum.

Tested by 42's Moulinette and the set of Francinette tests, which are actually more thorough than Moulinette itself!! Moulinette glanced over some obvious errors which should have failed my assignment.

Today I have added some functions here, which I will be using in my PrintF assignment I currently work on. 
They are the followig: 
ft_strupcase, which takes lower case letters in a string and promotes them to upper case, returns pointer to the string
ft_strdncase, same as the above but inverted
ft_utoa, which takes unsigned int and converts it to a string
ft_bitoa (itoa_base) which takes an int and converts it to a new base, returning string. All but the decimal base results are unsigned.
